# Obstacle Avoiding Car

An Obstacle Avoidance car is an intelligent robot, which can automatically sense and overcome obstacles on its path. It contains of a Microcontroller to process the data, and Ultrasonic sensors to detect the obstacles on its path. Obstacle avoidance is one of the most important aspects of mobile robotics.

This obstacle-avoiding car is using the Arduino microcontroller as its main motherboard including some sensors and electronic modules. It uses the L298N H-Bridge driver to control the 4 wheels of motors. The design diagram is given below. 

## Components

1) Arduino Uno
2) L298N motor drive
3) Wheels (4x) 
4) TT Gear Motor (4x)
